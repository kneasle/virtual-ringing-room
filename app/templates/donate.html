                We decided to create the Ringing Room in order to facilitate continued engagement with ringing
                during the coronavirus crisis and are deeply honored by the enthusiasm and support the community
                has shown us. If you'd like to help us keep the site up and running into the future, the best way
                to support us is on Patreon:
